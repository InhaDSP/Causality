# Causality
Causality is a portable protocol for quickly developing HCI applications for social interactions based on the context through cause and effect.  
The detailed proposal of this protocol is published as a paper in HCI International 2021 as a part of the Communications in Computer and Information Science book series (CCIS, volume 1421). [[Link](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78645-8_43)]

abstract="This paper proposes Causality, a portable protocol for quickly developing HCI applications for social interactions based on the context through cause and effect, and a Windows application assisting social and emotional behavior targeted to help people with autism spectrum disorder. For application's interactivity and convenient post-analysis, we added some enhancements to our protocol. For example, we implemented speech synthesis and recognition modules to promote users' participation and natural interactions. Our application generates a summary when the user finishes the application for the post-analysis of the user's interactions for further refinement. We expect our Causality protocol can help future researchers as a starting point to make their own social and sentimental assistance application without requiring extensive programming skills.",
